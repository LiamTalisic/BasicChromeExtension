# BasicChromeExtension

Repo where I will go over several interesting features I find while learning how to build out chrome extensions for another project I'm working on

## Getting Started

-   you will need a manifest.json file for your extension to work
-   you will need to load your extension into chrome by going to chrome://extensions/ and clicking on "Load unpacked" and selecting the folder that contains your extension

### Basic

-   this is the most basic chrome extension you can make, it uses action default_popup to create the default popup extension that appears when you click on the extension icon in the browser, which also means it will dissappear when you click outside of it.

### WIP

-   will add more later, for now, I have tested the features I actually need
