# createWindow

-   allows you to create a new window by clicking a button in the extension.

### Pros:

-   works in any webpage
-   doesnt require opening a new chrome window

### Cons:

-   can be blocked by CSP (Content Security Policy) on some websites

# injectDiv

-   allows you to inject a div into the webpage

### Pros:

-   I can't actually think of any pros to this, but it does seem interesting and definitely useful in some cases, if implemented correctly

### Cons:

-   frequently blocked by CSP (Content Security Policy) on many websites
-   fixed position (im sure you can fix this, but its not a feature I'm willing to spend the time to implement rn)
-   you'll see if you try it that it will take a lot of work to make useful, and even then it is definitely blocked all the time
